## 📒 Notebooks

### `eda_v01.ipynb`

Performs exploratory data analysis:
- Loads and parses the metabolomics matrix
- Separates control and diabetic groups
- Applies log transformation
- Handles missing values
- Generates:
  - PCA plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Boxplots of selected metabolites

### `ML_pipeline.ipynb`

Builds and evaluates classification models:
- **Preprocessing**
  - Label encoding of diagnosis
  - Normalization / standardization
  - Train-test split
- **Models**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation**
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - ROC-AUC curve
